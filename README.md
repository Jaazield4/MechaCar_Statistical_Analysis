# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview
Using the vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD we ran a linear multiline regression to determine if there is correlation
between these six categories and miles per gallon for a MechaCar prototype. We also clollected summary statistics to review the production data for each
manufacturing lot.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
We performed a multi-linear regression to see if we could predict the miles per gallon of the MechaCar Prototype. For the independent variables we used
vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angel, ground clearance and AWD. From running the multi-linear regression we came to the following conclusions.

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg value in the dataset?
- This is the anser

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or Why not?


3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar Prototypes effectively? Why or Why Not?
